# E-Commerce Back End

## Description

This is a back end example for a website. It mimics a e-commerce and shows categories, and their products. You can see the progress through the insominia live host. My motivation for this project was to see if i could successfully implement routes and connect many database tables to each other while interacting with sql. It solves having to use individule database tables and can provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. I learned about how interating with Sequelize with API's can make coding so much easier while managing multiple tables.

## Installation

No installation required

## Usage

To use just install

run npm start

then view the live host on port 3001!
